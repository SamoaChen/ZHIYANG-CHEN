## [Centralized Robotic Arm Hybrid Position Force Control](https://github.com/SamoaChen/2-Linkages-Robotic-Arm-Hybrid-Position-Force-Control)                 
### *April-July 2020*

* Designed and built a 2 linkages robotic arm out of cardboard during quarantine, and achieve centralized position control, hybrid position force control, and achieved object tracing with stereo vision
* Designed and constructed an angle overshoot-proofing mechanism for two DC motors
* Derived EOM and jacobian matrix, simulated centralized controller in MATLAB, and converted to NumPy version
* Integrated modules Arduino, Raspberry pi, DC motors with encoder, Motor Driver, FSR sensor, Potentiometer, Lever Switch
* Implemented the controller through serial communication between Raspberry pi and Arduino Uno
* Calibrated and built a stereo camera and coded an object 3D coordinate measuring program
* Integrated the stereo camera with robot arm controller and achieved object tracing with the robotic arm end-effector
