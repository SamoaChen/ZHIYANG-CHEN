1. Designed and built a 2 linkages robotic arm out of cardboard during quarantine, and achieve centralized position control, hybrid position force control, and achieved object tracing with stereo vision
1. Designed and constructed an angle overshoot-proofing mechanism for two DC motors
1. Derived EOM and jacobian matrix, simulated centralized controller in MATLAB, and converted to NumPy version
1. Integrated modules Arduino, Raspberry pi, DC motors with encoder, Motor Driver, FSR sensor, Potentiometer, Lever Switch
1. Implemented the controller through serial communication between Raspberry pi and Arduino Uno
1. Calibrated and built a stereo camera and coded an object 3D coordinate measuring program
1. Integrated the stereo camera with robot arm controller and achieved object tracing with the robotic arm end-effector

## Project 2:
## [Stereo Vision Based Robotic Manipulator](https://github.com/SamoaChen/2-Linkages-Robotic-Arm-Hybrid-Position-Force-Control)
